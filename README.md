The Von Nuemann Probe Game in development

The Gameplan

1. Build the data storage in JSON files concerning the player and narrative data.

2. Program movement and acceleration with javascript, and test with a '3-D' star map.

3. Flush out other components of the game such as balancing factions and adding in resources. 

4. Once basic functionality is down, begin sprucing up the game in order to be ready to be kickstarted. 
Once the game can be played by a single player, then post on kickstarter

5a. (If not backed) Look for private investors (somehow) and/or professional coders who would get a percentage of profits made off the game.

5b. (If backed) Hire two or three coders all focusing on programming a balanced A.I while Peter and Nebbie continue to bug hunt as well as 
flush out the narrative portion of the game

6. Once a playable copy is ready, send these to backers or make it avaliable for backers to play. As it is a webgame, there is no cost to playing
but mandatory ads on the homescreen. These backers will recieve a copy without any ads. 

7. Once the backers have sent in bug reports for a month or so, buy a public domain and release the game officially with a game trailer. 

8. Maintain a little bug support for the game. If possible, hire somebody to do this to lessen stress. Then...... Profit?
